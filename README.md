# Garduino-ESP-Blynk
A wireless (solar poweed) sensor controlled garden irrigation system.

This is still a work in progress. I'll write up a readme later on but feel free to pick it up and try it out. 

Hardware: 

5V 4-way relay board (LOW active)
ESP8266 (WeMos/NodeMCU style)
Liquid Flow meter (just the basic type)
12VDC Solenoid water valves

Software:

Load up the INO sketches and match the pinouts from the code. 
Download the Blynk mobile app and create a project, add your base and 3 sensors as devices and email yourself the auth codes and put them in the sketchs.
